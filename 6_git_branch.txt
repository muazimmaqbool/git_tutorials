Git Branching Basics
========================

1️⃣ What is a Git Branch?
--------------------------
A **branch** in Git is a separate line of development.  
It allows you to work on features, fixes, or experiments **without affecting the main codebase**.

The default branch is usually called `main` or `master`.

✅ Benefits of using branches:
- Isolate new features
- Work on bug fixes independently
- Test code changes without risk
- Collaborate without breaking the main code

---

2️⃣ View Existing Branches
---------------------------
Command:
    git branch

🔹 Lists all local branches
🔹 The current branch will have an asterisk `*` next to it

---

3️⃣ Create a New Branch
------------------------
Command:
    git branch <branch-name>

Example:
    git branch feature/login

This creates a new branch called `feature/login` but does **not** switch to it.

---

4️⃣ Switch to Another Branch
-----------------------------
Command:
    git checkout <branch-name>

Example:
    git checkout feature/login

✅ This switches your working directory to the specified branch.

---

5️⃣ Create and Switch to New Branch (Shortcut)
-----------------------------------------------
Command:
    git checkout -b <branch-name>

Example:
    git checkout -b feature/homepage

This creates the branch **and** switches to it in a single command.

---

6️⃣ View All Branches (Local + Remote)
---------------------------------------
Command:
    git branch -a

Shows:
- Local branches
- Remote tracking branches (from origin)

---

✅ Summary of Useful Commands
------------------------------
🔸 List branches:
    git branch

🔸 Create branch:
    git branch new-feature

🔸 Switch branch:
    git checkout new-feature

🔸 Create & switch:
    git checkout -b new-feature

🔸 All branches:
    git branch -a

📌 Tip:
Keep your branches named clearly (e.g., `feature/contact-form`, `fix/login-bug`) to make your work organized and understandable.
