=======================

📌 What is `git rebase`?
----------------------------
`git rebase` is used to **move or combine a sequence of commits** to a new base commit. It allows you to "replay" your changes on top of another branch.

It helps:
- Keep history linear and clean
- Integrate changes from one branch into another

🧠 Why Use Rebase?

✅ Makes project history easier to read  
✅ Useful for feature branches to stay up-to-date  
✅ Avoids unnecessary merge commits  
✅ Rewrites commit history for cleaner collaboration

🛠️ How to Use `git rebase`
--------------------------------

🔹 1. Rebase your feature branch with the latest `main`:
        git checkout feature-branch
        git rebase main


🔹 2. If conflicts occur, resolve them, then:
        git add .
        git rebase --continue

🔹 3. To abort rebase and return to previous state:
        git rebase --abort
