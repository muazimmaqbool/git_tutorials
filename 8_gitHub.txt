Introduction to GitHub

1Ô∏è‚É£ What is GitHub?
--------------------
üîπ GitHub is a cloud-based platform for hosting Git repositories.
    Note: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and 
          each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
üîπ It allows individuals and teams to collaborate, share code, and track version history.
üîπ It is built around Git ‚Äî the version control system ‚Äî and adds features like:
   - Pull requests
   - Issue tracking
   - Actions for CI/CD
   - Project boards and much more

4Ô∏è‚É£ How to Create a Repository on GitHub
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to https://github.com and log in  
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right ‚Üí "New repository"
3. Fill in:
   - Repository name
   - Description (optional)
   - Public or Private
   - Initialize with README (optional)
4. Click "Create repository"

5Ô∏è‚É£ Connecting Local Repo to GitHub
-----------------------------------
üîπ Step 1: Initialize Git in your local project (if not done)
    > git init

üîπ Step 2: Add your files and commit
    > git add .
    > git commit -m "Initial commit"

üîπ Step 3: Add the GitHub repository as remote
    > git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

üîπ Step 4: Push to GitHub
    > git push -u origin main
            or
    > git push --set-upstream origin main

Note:
- Replace `main` with `master` if your default branch is named that.
- You may be asked to log in or authenticate using a token.

---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Pulling from GitHub
------------------------
Command:
    git pull origin main

This will "fetch and merge" changes from the remote `main` branch into your local project.
Note: pull is basically combination of two different commands: fetch and merge

Use this regularly to "stay updated" with the latest code on GitHub.

‚úÖ Summary
-----------
- GitHub hosts your Git repositories online
- Helps teams and individuals collaborate
- You push to upload, and pull to download updates
- Use `git remote add origin <repo-url>` to connect your local repo to GitHub
