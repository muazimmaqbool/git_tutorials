Introduction to GitHub
=======================

1️⃣ What is GitHub?
--------------------
🔹 GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** for hosting Git repositories.
    Note: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and 
          each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
🔹 It allows individuals and teams to **collaborate**, **share code**, and **track version history**.
🔹 It is built around Git — the version control system — and adds features like:
   - Pull requests
   - Issue tracking
   - Actions for CI/CD
   - Project boards and wikis

5️⃣ Connecting Local Repo to GitHub
-----------------------------------
🔹 Step 1: Initialize Git in your local project (if not done)
    git init

🔹 Step 2: Add your files and commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"

🔹 Step 3: Add the GitHub repository as remote
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

🔹 Step 4: Push to GitHub
    git push -u origin main

Note:
- Replace `main` with `master` if your default branch is named that.
- You may be asked to log in or authenticate using a token.

6️⃣ Pulling from GitHub
------------------------
Command:
    git pull origin main

This will **fetch and merge** changes from the remote `main` branch into your local project.

Use this regularly to **stay updated** with the latest code on GitHub.

- Helps teams and individuals collaborate
- You push to upload, and pull to download updates
- Use `git remote add origin <repo-url>` to connect your local repo to GitHub
