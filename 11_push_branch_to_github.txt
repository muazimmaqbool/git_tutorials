Pushing a Local Branch to GitHub (Step-by-Step)
==========================================

📌 Scenario:
You’ve created a new "local branch" to work on a feature. Now you want to:
- Push it to GitHub
- Collaborate or review via a Pull Request
- Merge it into the main branch
- Then delete the feature branch if it’s no longer needed

---

1️⃣ Step 1: Create a New Local Branch
---------------------------------------
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature

This creates and switches you to a new local branch called `feature/new-feature`.

---

2️⃣ Step 2: Make Some Changes
------------------------------
Modify any file or create a new one. For example:
- Edit `index.html`
- Add `about.html`

---

3️⃣ Step 3: Stage the Changes
------------------------------
    git add .

This stages all new/modified files.

---

4️⃣ Step 4: Commit the Changes
-------------------------------
    git commit -m "Add new about page and update homepage"

This records your changes locally.

---

5️⃣ Step 5: Push the Branch to GitHub
--------------------------------------
    git push origin feature/new-feature

✅ This command:
- Uploads your local branch to GitHub
- Creates a remote branch with the same name

---

6️⃣ Step 6: Create a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub
--------------------------------------------------
1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. You’ll see a **"Compare & pull request"** button – click it  
   (or go to the "Pull Requests" tab and click "New pull request")
3. Choose the base (e.g., `main`) and compare it with your branch (e.g., `feature/new-feature`)
4. Add a title & description and click **"Create pull request"**

---

7️⃣ Step 7: Merge the Pull Request
------------------------------------
- Review changes
- Resolve any **merge conflicts** if GitHub shows them
- Click **"Merge pull request"** → Confirm merge

---

8️⃣ Step 8: Delete the Branch (Optional)
-----------------------------------------
After merging, you can clean up:

🔹 On GitHub (after PR is merged):
    Click **"Delete branch"**

🔹 Locally (optional):
    git branch -d feature/new-feature

If the branch isn't merged yet, use `-D` to force delete:
    git branch -D feature/new-feature

---

✅ Summary
-----------
🔸 Create & work on a local branch:
    git checkout -b feature/xyz

🔸 Stage, commit, and push to GitHub:
    git add .
    git commit -m "message"
    git push origin feature/xyz

🔸 Create a Pull Request on GitHub  
🔸 Merge and delete the branch if no longer needed

---

💡 Tip:
Use descriptive names like `feature/login-page` or `fix/navbar-bug` for clarity.
