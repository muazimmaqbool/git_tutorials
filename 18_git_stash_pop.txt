git stash and pop Command
=======================

📌 What is `git stash`?
----------------------------
`git stash` is used to "temporarily save uncommitted changes" (both staged and unstaged) without committing them.

This allows you to:
- Switch branches
- Pull updates
- Fix something urgent (without losing your current work!)

🧠 When to Use `git stash`?
-----------------------------
✅ You’re in the middle of working on something, but need to:
   - Switch to another branch
   - Fix a bug elsewhere
   - Do a `git pull`, but your changes would conflict

✅ You want to save your changes for later, but don’t want to commit them yet.
