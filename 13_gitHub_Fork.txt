GitHub Fork Explained
=========================

📌 What is a Fork?
---------------------
A **fork** is a personal copy of someone else’s repository on GitHub.

It allows you to:
- Experiment with changes without affecting the original project
- Submit pull requests to contribute to the original repository
- Use it as a starting point for your own project

---

🧠 Why Do We Fork?
---------------------
🔹 To contribute to open-source projects  
🔹 To customize or build on existing repositories  
🔹 To explore and learn from someone else’s code  
🔹 To propose changes (via pull requests) when you don’t have direct access to the main repo

---

🛠️ How to Fork a Repository on GitHub
---------------------------------------
1. Go to the repository you want to fork (e.g., https://github.com/original-owner/project-name)  
2. Click the **“Fork”** button in the top-right corner  
3. Choose your GitHub account (if prompted)

✅ A new repository will be created in your GitHub profile:  
`https://github.com/your-username/project-name`

---

💻 How to Clone Your Fork to Local
-------------------------------------
After forking, you need to work on it locally.

🔹 Step 1: Copy the URL of your forked repo  
Example:  
`https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`

🔹 Step 2: Clone it to your local system

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

🔹 Step 3: Go inside the project folder

    cd project-name

✅ Now you can work on this project, create branches, commit, push, and open pull requests.
