Basic Introduction to Git and GitHub:

->What is Git?
  Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code.
  It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. 
  
->Git also enables you to:
    Save versions of your code
    Switch between different features or experiments using branches
    Revert to earlier code states if needed
    Collaborate efficiently with teams

->What is GitHub?
  GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. 
  It builds on top of Git by adding collaboration tools like:
    Remote repositories for easy sharing
    Pull requests for reviewing code
    Issues and discussions for tracking bugs or new features
    GitHub Actions for automation (e.g., CI/CD pipelines)

->GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with other developers, contribute to open-source projects, and manage your own code in the cloud.

->Make sure you have Git installed. You can download it from: https://git-scm.com/
  After downloading run this command: git --version to check installed version
