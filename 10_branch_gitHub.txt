Working with GitHub Branches Locally
===================================

1️⃣ Creating a New Branch on GitHub
------------------------------------
🔹 Step 1: Go to your repository on https://github.com  
🔹 Step 2: Click the dropdown showing current branch (usually "main" or "master")  
🔹 Step 3: Type a new branch name and click "Create branch: your-branch-name"

✅ A new remote branch is now created on GitHub.

---

2️⃣ Getting the New GitHub Branch Locally
-----------------------------------------

You won’t automatically see this new branch in your local Git.

🔹 Step 1: Fetch all remote branches

    git fetch origin

🔹 Step 2: View all branches (including remote)

    git branch -a

This will list:
- Local branches (e.g., `main`, `feature-x`)
- Remote branches (e.g., `remotes/origin/new-feature`)

---

3️⃣ Creating a Local Branch from Remote
----------------------------------------

🔹 Step 3: Checkout the new remote branch as a local branch

    git checkout -b local-branch-name origin/remote-branch-name

Example:
    git checkout -b new-feature origin/new-feature

✅ This creates a local branch called `new-feature` that tracks the remote branch.

Now any changes you pull/push on `new-feature` will sync with the one on GitHub.

---

4️⃣ Verifying Branch Connection
-------------------------------

You can confirm the tracking relationship with:

    git branch -vv

It shows which remote branch each local branch is tracking.

---

✅ Summary
-----------
🔸 Create a branch on GitHub via the UI  
🔸 Fetch new remote branches:
    git fetch origin

🔸 View all branches:
    git branch -a

🔸 Create a local branch from a GitHub branch:
    git checkout -b <local> origin/<remote>

🔸 Verify with:
    git branch -vv

---

💡 Tip:
Always pull after checking out a remote branch to make sure you have the latest updates.
